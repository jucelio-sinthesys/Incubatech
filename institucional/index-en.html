    <p>
      <strong>Incubatech</strong> is a strategic and fully virtual unit dedicated to identifying, incubating, and accelerating science- and technology-based projects with strong potential for impact and value creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work in collaboration with universities, companies, public institutions, and international networks to turn ideas into viable, scalable, and sustainable ventures.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Guiding Principles:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scientific and technical excellence</li>
      <li>Commitment to concrete and measurable results</li>
      <li>Ethics, confidentiality, and respect for authorship</li>
      <li>Collaboration, transparency, and social impact</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Although virtual, Incubatech relies on a strong network of partners who can provide physical, technical, and institutional support whenever needed. Our hybrid model ensures agility and outreach without compromising rigor and reliability.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe innovation can arise anywhere — and it's our mission to help it go as far as possible.
