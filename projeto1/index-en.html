    <h2>AI for Automated Interpretation of Public Policies</h2>

    <p>
      This project aims to apply Artificial Intelligence to automatically interpret and convert public policy documents into structured, accessible, and actionable information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proposal combines techniques such as NLP (Natural Language Processing), semantic analysis, neural networks, and knowledge models to enhance the understanding and implementation of government, regulatory, and administrative guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initiative was developed within the L.I.S.I. – Laboratory of Integrated Science & Innovation, and received methodological support from Incubatech for technical validation, business modeling, and institutional articulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project intends to positively impact public administration by promoting greater efficiency, transparency, and civic participation.
